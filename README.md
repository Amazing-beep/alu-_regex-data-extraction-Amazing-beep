# alu_regex-data-extraction-Amazing-beep

## Project Overview

This project extracts various types of data from large text strings using Regular Expressions in Python. It covers at least 8 different data types, including email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, time formats, HTML tags, hashtags, and currency amounts.

The goal is to demonstrate accurate regex patterns that handle multiple common formats and edge cases.
